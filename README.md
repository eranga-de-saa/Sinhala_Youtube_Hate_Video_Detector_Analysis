# Hate Content Detection in Sinhala YouTube Videos

This repository contains the implementation of a **Self-Reflective and Introspective Feature Model** for detecting hate content in Sinhala-language YouTube videos using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques.

## üìñ Overview

The system classifies YouTube videos as hateful or non-hateful based on:

* User comments
* Thumbnail text
* Video metadata (title, description, tags)
* Like/dislike ratios
* Positive/negative comment ratios

The model achieves **\~89% accuracy** using a Logistic Regression classifier with TF-IDF vectorization and handcrafted linguistic features.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

* **Video Dataset:** 1,000 Sinhala YouTube videos (450 hateful, 550 non-hateful)
* **Comment Dataset:** 2,000 user comments (1,050 positive, 950 negative)

Data was manually annotated using majority voting by three annotators based on YouTube‚Äôs hate speech policy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing

* Removal of hashtags, punctuation, emojis
* Tokenization using NLTK
* Part-of-Speech tagging (using UCSC POS dataset)
* Stemming

### 2. Negation Handling

Handled Sinhala negators like **‡∂±‡∑ê, ‡∂±‡∑ë, ‡∂±‡∑ê‡∑Ñ‡∑ê, ‡∂±‡∑ê‡∂≠, ‡∂∂‡∑ê, ‡∂∂‡∑ë, ‡∂∂‡∑ê‡∑Ñ‡∑ê, ‡∂∂‡∑ê‡∂∫, ‡∂ë‡∂¥‡∑è** by prefixing affected words with `not_`.

### 3. Feature Extraction

* **Text Vectorization:** TF-IDF, Count Vectorization, Word2Vec
* **Lexicon-based Features:** Positive/negative word percentages
* **Metadata Features:** Like/dislike ratio, positive/negative comment ratio

### 4. Classification Models

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
